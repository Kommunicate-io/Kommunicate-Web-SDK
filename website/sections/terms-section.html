                    <li>"Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the
                        month in which the Kommunicate Platform, as applicable, was in the state of "Unavailable." Monthly
                        Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any Kommunicate
                        Exclusion (as defined below).
