Installing Kommunicate in your Android app is easy and fast. We will walk you through the procedure so you can start answering your support queries within few minutes.<br />

## Installation 

Add the following in your app build.gradle dependency:

```
compile 'io.kommunicate:kommunicate:1.6.1'
```

After the app has successfully build, open your Application Class(If you do not have an application class, create one) and add implement the ```KmActionCallback``` interface:

```
 public class KommunicateApplication extends MultiDexApplication implements KmActionCallback {
```

Then override the ```KmActionCallback```'s ```onReceive``` method :

```
 @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, final Object object, String action) {

        switch (action) {
             //This action will be received on click of the default start new chat button
            case Kommunicate.START_NEW_CHAT:
                List<String> agents = new ArrayList<>(); //add your agents to this list
                List<String> bots = new ArrayList<>(); //add your bots to this list
                 try {
                    KmHelper.setStartNewChat(context, agents, bots);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                break;
             //This action will be received on click of logout option in menu
            case Kommunicate.LOGOUT_CALL:
                KmHelper.performLogout(context, object); //object will receive the exit Activity, the one that will be launched when logout is successfull
                break;
        }
    }
```

The above method will receive the callbacks with an object. You can do your custom operations based on the actions received or use Kommunicate's default actions.
