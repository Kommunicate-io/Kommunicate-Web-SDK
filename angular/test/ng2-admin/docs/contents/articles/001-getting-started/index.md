## What is ng2-admin?

ng2-admin is a front-end Admin Dashboard template based on Angular, Bootstrap 4 and Angular CLI. That means all the 
data you can see on graphs, charts and tables is mocked in Javascript so you can use the 
backend of your choice with no limitations.

## How can it help me?

We believe that at the moment a lot of business applications have administration/management interfaces inside of them. Sometimes it's not that obvious, but a lot of web applications have dashboards with panels, charts analytics, etc.

ng2-admin aims to bootstrap the development of your product and provide an 
ecosystem for building production-ready application or prototypes.

Frameworks like Bootstrap provide a number of components, but usually it's not enough to 
build a real-world app. This template comes with lots of popular UI components with a unified color scheme, 
plus it is based on a modern Angular framework and has a flexible component based structure.

You can also use ng2-admin for the purpose of learning Angular.
