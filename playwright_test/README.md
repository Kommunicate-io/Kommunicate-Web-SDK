## Installing Playwright
Get started by installing Playwright using npm.

```js
npm init playwright@latest
```

Run the install command and select the following to get started:

- Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript (we are using JavaScript)
- Name of your Tests folder (default is tests or e2e if you already have a tests folder in your project)

## Folder Structure

Playwright will download the browsers needed as well as create the following files.
```js
playwright.config.js
package.json
package-lock.json
tests/
  example.spec.js
tests-examples/
  demo-todo-app.spec.js
```
The [playwright.config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) is where you can add configuration for Playwright including modifying which browsers you would like to run Playwright on. If you are running tests inside an already existing project then dependencies will be added directly to your `package.json`.

The `tests` folder contains a basic example test to help you get started with testing. For a more detailed example check out the `tests-examples` folder which contains tests written to test a todo app.
