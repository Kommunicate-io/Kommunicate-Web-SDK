React-Login-Demo Project

Goal - Every time a new user logs in with their new email ID, the new chat widget should open, logging out the old chat widget.

 - When the user enters their email and clicks the login button, the handleClick function is triggered, invoking the logout function. Consequently, it toggles the callAgain state, prompting an update for the new widget.

 - All code pertaining to the activation of the bot widget is contained within the chat.js file, and the update for the logged-in user's email is also managed within this file.
